## Overview

**BLETalk** is a powerful React Native toolkit designed to streamline Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) interactions in cross-platform mobile applications. It enables developers to create connected apps with seamless device management, real-time messaging, and a polished, customizable UI. Built for scalability and developer experience, BLETalk supports iOS, Android, and web platforms via Expo.

**Why Choose BLETalk?**

BLETalk combines robust BLE functionality with a modern development stack, making it ideal for rapid prototyping and production-ready IoT or connected mobile applications. For a complete BLE testing experience, pair BLETalk with its companion firmware project, [**BLETalk_ESP32**](https://github.com/BirdRa1n/BLETalk_ESP32), which demonstrates BLE communication with an ESP32 device.

## Features

- üß© **Effortless BLE Management**: Scan, pair, and communicate with BLE devices using an intuitive API.
- üåà **Cross-Platform Styling**: Achieve a consistent look with Tailwind CSS, NativeWind, and Expo configurations.
- üì± **Reusable UI Components**: Modular buttons, containers, headers, and navigation for rapid development.
- üöÄ **Developer-Friendly Tools**: TypeScript, ESLint, Prettier, and Babel ensure clean, maintainable code.
- üîí **Permissions & Notifications**: Simplified handling of Bluetooth, location permissions, and background notifications.
- ‚öôÔ∏è **Flexible Architecture**: Configurable setup for iOS, Android, and web with minimal overhead.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:
